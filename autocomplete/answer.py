#     Modify, because we don't want too many unused records.
#     New record, because user should be able to change their answer anytime, even if other people voted for it.
#         This implies that answer record is independent of creator, once other people vote for it.
#             If creator changes answer that is displayed to voter, then change might happen before vote, and voter wanted to vote for old answer.
#                 Not so bad for reason voting, but very bad if answer changes from yes to no.
#         Rather than changing answer from owned to voted (with possible race condition),
#         always have answer un-owned, and delete answer when no votes (also possible race)?
# 
# Assume answers are un-modifiable, because user should be able to change their answer anytime, even if other people voted for it, 
# and because voter may vote for answer that was changed after display, and for keyword-search indexing.
#     Each user x question stores a copy of answer, and suggested matching answer records are counted?  (Counts cached?)
#     Or only unique answers are stored, only as long as it has voteCount > 0 or author is question creator?
#         Never modify answer. Periodically delete unused answers, maybe.
#             For efficiency, delete zero-vote answers with creator=voter when creator votes, to prevent one user from making lots of answers.
#             Just delete the previously-voted answer from user when voting, if it has zero votes.
